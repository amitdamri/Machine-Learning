This repository contains my projects that were implemented as part of the Machine Learning course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 3 projects - Naive Bayes, Ensemble Models, and Clinical Data Prediction.

---

The porjects were implemented in python, using Jupyter Notebook.

## Projects
1. Naive Bayes - In this project I tested digits classification on the MNIST dataset, using Bernoulli Naive Bayes (a generative model). In addition, I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier and classified the "20 newsgroups" data set using my own classifier and compared to the scikit learn built in version.

2. Ensemble Models - practice Adaboost classifier and Condorcet's Jury Theorem (1785).

3. Clinical Data Prediction - In this exercise, I used 3 types of prediction models and compared between them:
The first model is a linear classifier, the second one is an ensemble model, and the third is a DL one.
</br><strong>concepts:</strong> train/validation/test split, grid-search, cross validation, and more.
</br><strong>sections:</strong> Loading the data (clean and transform). Then training of the three models. Finally, a comparison between the three: quantitative and qualitative.
